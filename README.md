# Desk Setup

An idea born from a friend of mine and his website re-branding in which he wanted to show his desk setup. So I came up with this. Enjoy! 😉

## 🎯 About

I've configured an environment that handles Pug/SCSS/JS in order to work as quick as possible on this tool that I will adopt also for my personal website in the near future (🤫 Shhht! Spoiler!).
