# Desk Setup

An idea born from a friend of mine and his website re-branding in which he wanted to show his desk setup. So I came up with this. Enjoy! üòâ

## üéØ About

I've configured an environment that handles Pug/SCSS/JS in order to work as quick as possible on this tool that I will adopt also for my personal website in the near future (ü§´ Shhht! Spoiler!)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demo

## :books: How to

In order to add/remove or change the position of the hotspots, you can follow these easy steps:

1. Go inside `/src/views` folder;
2. In this folder you can see the `/mixins` folder which contains `hotspot.pug` that is responsible for the HTML structure of the single hotspot.
It accepts a **title**, the **content** of the hotspot and the classname responsible for the **placement of the hotspot's content** (ie: "placed-left").
In order to determine where to display the hotspot content div you can use the following class names:
   - `placed-left`
   - `placed-right`
   - `placed-top`
   - `placed-bottom`
3. Inside views folder, along with the mixin one, you can find the `/pages` folder that contains `desk.pug`, the content of the page;
4. `desk.pug` contains n `+hotspot` mixins based on user preferences (ie: in this demo I use 9 hotspots);
5. If you want to add new hotspots, you can do that by adding as many hotspots you want inside the `desk.pug`.
6. Then, inside `/src/scss/index.scss` file, under `desk__hotspot` class name, you can find the selectors `nth-of-type(n)` which determines every sigle hotspot placement inside the image.
7. Add a new one for each hotspot you will add.
